#### Communication distance test (direct visibility) by using antennas

| **Distance** | **Msg. lost** |
|--------------|---------------|
|   **25 m**   |  about 10%    |
|   **40 m**   |  about 60%    |

*This measure is not exact. It dependent on many factors*

### Customize of Lib VirtualWire to VirtualWire_TX

|       **Lib**     | **Size (bytes)** |
|-------------------|------------------|
|**VirtualWire**    |  2200    |
|**VirtualWire_TX** |  2338    |

#### <span style="color:red">VirtualWire_TX is NOT beater :(</span>
#### <span style="color:red">We will have to fix some variables for optimization of code (size of compiled binary)</span>
